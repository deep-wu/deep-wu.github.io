## Biography
I am a Professor and Ph.D. supervisor at the School of Artificial Intelligence and Big Data, Hefei University. My research focuses on deep learning-driven video and image processing, multimodal perception computing, and algorithm optimization.

I have led multiple national and provincial-level research projects, including the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), Anhui Provincial Key R&D Plan, and major industry-academic cooperation projects. My research funding includes two projects with over 1 million RMB in grants.

I have published over 40 peer-reviewed papers in high-impact journals such as IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (TIP), IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation (TEVC), IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (TMM), Information Fusion, and Pattern Recognition. I serve as a reviewer for IEEE T-PAMI, TIP, TMM, TCSVT, TEVC, PR, AAAI, and IJCAI.
