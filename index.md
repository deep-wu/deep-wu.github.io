## About Me
I am a **Professor** and a Ph.D. supervisor in the **School of Artificial Intelligence and Big Data at Hefei University**. My research focuses on **deep learning-driven video and image processing, multimodal perception computing, and algorithm optimization**.  

I have led multiple **national and provincial-level research projects**, including the **National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), Anhui Provincial Key R&D Plan, and major industry-academic cooperation projects**. My research funding includes two projects with over 1 million RMB in grants.  

I have published over **40 peer-reviewed papers** in high-impact journals such as **IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (TIP), IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation (TEVC), IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (TMM), Information Fusion, and Pattern Recognition**. I serve as a reviewer for **IEEE T-PAMI, TIP, TMM, TCSVT, TEVC, PR, AAAI, and IJCAI**.
